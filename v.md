# Victory! We now "know the tubes".

We learned that

- The internet is really complex,
- is constrained by the speed of light over fiber,
- thus we want to locate our servers close to the clients,
- that you can tell way too much about a web server and about your own IP from public tools,
- that an entire system helps us translate from human-readable terms to machine (router-understandable) terms,
- that routers need to be pretty intelligent in how they "forward" data, and
- that even the simplest systems to use (enter URL, hit enter!) are quite complex.

Welcome to CS, the rabbit-hole goes deep!
