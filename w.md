# Are the tubes physics-based, or do they wormhole (W)?

- **Question W1:** How fast are the tubes?
	What are the upper and lower limits of how fast the tubes are?

- **Question W2:** If we traveled to Mars, would the tubes follow along with us?
	How would the tubes change?
	What are their fundamental limitations?
	What does [this](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+travel+time+to+mars+from+earth) tell us?

- **Question W3:** Can that same webpage help us understand the terrestrial tube speeds?

[This tool](https://www.uptrends.com/tools/cdn-performance-check) enables us to see how long it takes for various locations to reach a webpage.
Add in `www.gwu.edu`, and "start test".
There is some "noise" in these results, so they aren't perfect, but they give you a sense of how long it takes to access the webpage from around the world.

- **Question W4:**: Looking at some of these values.
	Compare with your brainstorming from Question W3.
	Since GWU is in Washington, DC, does all of this make sense?

Use that same tool to lookup `lobste.rs` which is a webpage hosted in [Oregon](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=ip+for+lobste.rs).

- **Question W5:** Contrast the previous results from `www.gwu.edu` with these results.
	Are there any odd happenings?
	Try explaining them.
