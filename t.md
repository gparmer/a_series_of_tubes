# What are the tubes (T)? How do they work?

- **Question T1:** How does information get from your computer to a webpage and back?

- **Question T2:** What is in the request sent over the tubes, and what is in the reply?

- **Question T3:** How is it possible that the tubes are so reliable?
	Is it somehow the case that requests and replies always make it from us to the server and back without any issues?
	Or is something else going on?

- **Question T4:** Is there an individual tube carrying data between each of our computers and each server and back?
	If not, what other options are there?

The [next stop](./w.md) on our tour of the tubes.
